DSA Visualizer is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project designed to help computer science students understand and visualize data structures and algorithms (DSA) problems. This tool provides visual representations of various algorithms, highlighting their best and worst time complexities, and supports sorting algorithms in both ascending and descending orders.

## Features

- **Algorithm Visualization**: Watch step-by-step visualizations of various DSA problems.
- **Time Complexity Analysis**: Learn about the best-case and worst-case time complexities for each algorithm.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Visualize sorting algorithms and see how they perform on different datasets in ascending and descending order.
- **Interactive Learning**: Engage with the algorithms through an intuitive and interactive interface.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the functionality and interactivity.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

- A web browser
- A code editor (optional, for customization)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Qaiserfarooq285/DSA-Problems-Solver/tree/main/images.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start using the DSA Visualizer.

## Usage

1. **Select an Algorithm**: Choose the algorithm you want to visualize from the dropdown menu.
2. **Set Parameters**: Configure any necessary parameters for the algorithm.
3. **Run Visualization**: Click the "Visualize" button to start the animation and observe the algorithm in action.
4. **Analyze Complexity**: Review the displayed time complexity information to understand the algorithm's efficiency.
